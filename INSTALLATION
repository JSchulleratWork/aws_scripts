Hello All,

Not sure what all to say here for how to install these scripts. Here is what I do:
sudo mkdir /opt/aws
sudo chown $USER /opt/aws
# Install the Amazon CLI 
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
# The next command puts all the support stuff in /opt/aws/aws-cli and the aws bin in
# /usr/local/bin
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /opt/aws/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin/aws
cd /opt/aws
git clone https://github.com/jchrisfarris/aws_scripts.git

# This will add the helper script to your .profile so it is run when you spawn a new session
echo ". /opt/aws/aws_scripts/bin/aws_account.sh" >> ~/.profile

The above assumes you have installed xcode and the xcode cli tools and agreed to the terms.
Try running git --version to make sure all that works.
